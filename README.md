# Winning Heaven - Next.js (React) SPA + PWA & Capacitor (APK)

A modern, highly responsive, dark-themed casino and sweepstakes landing page, player lobby, and admin panel. This application is structured as a Next.js App Router (React) Single Page Application (SPA), complete with Progressive Web App (PWA) triggers and Capacitor.js integration to support compile-ready Android builds.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Key Features

* **Framework**: Next.js App Router (React.js) with client-side state synchronization.
* **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (modular variable system inside `src/app/globals.css`).
* **Database**: MongoDB database records:
  - `users`: Accounts table.
  - `games`: Casino catalog table.
  - `accountRequests`: Lobby requests table.
  - `gameAccounts`: Approved logins table.
  - `transactions`: Invoicing ledgers (contains Base64 screenshot proof attachments).
  - `paymentGateways`: Dynamic configurations for custom gateways (contains Base64 payment QR images).
* **Installable PWA**: Contains a web manifest (`manifest.json`) and a Service Worker (`sw.js`) so mobile users can install the application directly from Chrome or Safari with a native app icon.
* **APK Ready**: Pre-configured with **Capacitor.js** to package the build and export it as an Android application via Android Studio.

## 🔑 Environment Configuration & SMTP Settings

To send real OTP emails and enable Google Sign-In, define the following variables inside your **`.env.local`** file:

```env
# Secure Admin Portal Credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@winningheaven.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123

# Realtime: leave OFF on Hostinger Business (uses polling + push).
# On VPS only, set true for SSE instant admin updates:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SSE=true

# SMTP Server Configurations (GMAIL / SMTP Relay)
SMTP_USER=sender@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=gmail_app_password

# Google Sign-In OAuth Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
```

### 1. OTP Mail Flow
* The application sends a POST fetch request to `/api/send-otp`.
* If SMTP parameters are missing, the system runs in **Simulator Mode**, logging verification codes to the console and displaying an info alert box for local testing.
* If credentials are set, Gmail dispatches a templated verification email to the user.

### 2. Google OAuth Authentication Flow
* When the user clicks the "Continue with Google" button:
  - If they are inside Facebook/Messenger in-app browser, it shows a friendly browser limitations guide prompting them to open in Chrome or Safari.
  - If they are in a normal browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.) and a Google Client ID is configured, it launches the Google Sign-In popup, retrieves their profile (Name, Email), registers new players automatically, and logs them in.
  - If no Google Client ID is configured yet, it runs in **OAuth Simulator Mode**, showing a preview prompt and automatically logging them in with a test Google profile (`google-player@test.com`) for seamless test drives.

## 🔑 Secure Admin & Test Credentials

### 1. Player View (Landing page & Lobby)
* **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/`
* **Test Email**: `player@test.com`
* **Test Password**: `password123`

### 2. Secure Admin View (Staff Dashboard)

## 🔄 Dynamic Flows & Workflows

### 🎮 1. Games Library Logo Uploads
* Instead of dropdown selections, the admin can upload a custom logo/cover graphic file directly when adding or editing games inside the **Library** tab.
* The image is converted into a Base64 string and stored in the database.

### 💳 2. Payment Gateway QR Code Uploads
* Inside the **Payment Gateways** manager tab, the admin can upload a custom payment QR code graphic file directly.
* The image is encoded into a Base64 string, rendering dynamically inside the player checkout invoice box.

### 🔔 3. Toast Notifications & Scrollable Modals
* **Top-Right Alerts**: Banners float in the top-right corner to prevent overlapping with navigation buttons.
* **Scrollable Modals**: Overriding body elements ensure that forms scroll smoothly on smaller viewports.

## Mobile app delivery

The player lobby includes a **Get App** picker:

- Android downloads the signed APK from `/downloads/winning-heaven.apk`.
- iPhone shows the Safari **Share → Add to Home Screen** flow. On iOS 16.4+
  the installed Home Screen app can receive Web Push notifications.
- Both installed experiences load `https://winningheaven.com/`, so normal web
  deployments appear without reinstalling the app.

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run android:sync
npm run android:debug
npm run android:release
```

The release signing files `android/app/winning-heaven-release.keystore` and
`android/keystore.properties` are intentionally ignored by Git. Back up both
files securely. Future APK updates must use the same signing key or Android will
not install them over the existing app.

### Promo push configuration

Web Push uses these server variables:

```env
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:support@winningheaven.com
```

For closed-app Android APK notifications, create a free Firebase project:

1. Register Android app ID `com.winningheaven.app`.
2. Place `google-services.json` at `android/app/google-services.json`.
3. Configure one of the following server credential sets:

```env
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=
```

or:

```env
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=
```

Run `npm run android:release` again after adding `google-services.json`.
